5) What you need to provide the Manager so it can actually judge “looks worse”

The manager can’t guess. Give it at least one of these:

Screenshots (best): before/after for the bad spots

Or a short list of exact panels:

“Viewer > Edit tab right rail is too spaced out”

“Settings > X tab scroll feels wrong”

Or a screen recording showing resize behavior and where it feels bad

Without this, the manager will only validate mechanical correctness (min widths, scroll, splitters).



MANAGER REVIEW REQUEST

Active DIFF: docs/diffs/DIFF-001.md

Rules: Follow docs/agents/AGENT_PROMPT_MANAGER.md strictly.

Implementer completion report (paste below):

PASTE IMPLEMENTER REPORT HERE

Review requirements:

Confirm no scope violations

Confirm DIFF tagging coverage

Confirm verification checklist is realistically satisfied

If UI looks worse anywhere: identify specific locations and prescribe DIFF-allowed refinements or require DIFF-002

Output format:

Decision: APPROVE / REQUEST CHANGES / REJECT

Findings (bullet list)

Required actions (if any) with exact file + location guidance

“OK to lock DIFF” = Yes/No


What the Manager sends back to the Implementer (copy/paste template)
If it’s acceptable

Decision: APPROVE

Scope: OK

Tagging: OK

Checklist: OK
Owner may lock DIFF.

If “technically correct but looks worse”

Decision: REQUEST CHANGES
Required actions (DIFF-allowed only):

File: viewer.py — reduce excessive vertical gap in Edit rail by adjusting [specific layout section] from UI_SECTION_GAP to UI_INNER_GAP.

File: settings.py — scrollbar appears too early; set scroll area widget resizable and ensure only bodies are scrollable, not the full tab container.
Constraints:

Do not remove min widths

Do not remove scroll areas

No signal/logic changes
When done, re-submit completion report with updated tag list.

If it’s out of scope / broke rules

Decision: REJECT
Reason:

Scope violation found: [exact file/line/behavior]
Action:

Revert offending changes

Re-submit under correct DIFF or open DIFF-002




6) The rule that stops the all-night loop

If the complaint is aesthetic (density/balance/feel), manager must choose:

DIFF-001 still in progress: request targeted refinements if DIFF-001 allows them

DIFF-001 already satisfies scope but looks worse: manager mandates DIFF-002 (visual refinement DIFF)

This prevents endless churn inside the wrong DIFF.


7) Minimal “manager agent” prompt content (what it must enforce)

Your manager prompt must explicitly state:

Manager does not implement

Manager rejects scope creep

Manager requires evidence for “looks worse” (screens/panels)

Manager can require a new DIFF for aesthetic changes

If you want, paste your current AGENT_PROMPT_MANAGER.md and I’ll tighten it so it’s strict and actually effective.
